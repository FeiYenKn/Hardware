## Summary

The Nintendo Switch Art Cart is a fun little project aimed at making unique little wall part pieces for your favourite Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games.

There are three main pieces that snap together without the use of any screws or bolts.  Along with those three parts there is a universal wall mouting piece and also an art jig.  While the art jig is optional I would rightly recommend using it!  You only need one art jig for any number of art carts you make.

Under normal settings you should be able to make around 5-6 art carts per 1kg roll of filament.  

The template is designed around an 8x10 piece of photo paper although it will work just fine on an 8.5x11 piece of photo paper or normal paper.  

The universal wall mount features 3 main ways to attach to the wall:
- Directly to the wall via a screw<br/>
- To the wall via two sticky pads (command strips etc)<br/>
- Hung on the wall via a painting style hook or stick on (command hook etc)<br/>

## How to print the Nintendo Switch Art Cart:

A .3MF file is included which can be loaded into most slicers with a set of my recommended settings.  

To make each Nintendo Switch Art Cart you will need:
1 x Nintendo Switch Art Cart - Main Frame<br/>
1 x Nintendo Switch Art Cart - Mid Frame<br/>
1 x Nintendo Switch Art Cart - Back Bracket<br/>
1 x Nintendo Switch Art Cart - Wall Mount<br/>

Optional but highly recommended:
1 x Nintendo Switch Art Cart - Art Mounting Jig<br/>

These can be printed at normal layer height, there is no benifit to printing at a very low layer height.  

When printing the mid frame part it is recommended to enable ironing on the topmost surface so that the triangle part looks smooth.

## How to print and cut the Nintendo Switch Art Cart art:

This was made in Affinity Designer.  I have included a .PSD file but cannot guarntee it works the same way as I do not have Photoshop.  

The art file has two main sections to it, a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 grouping.  

These are setup so that you can move your art into the art layer and it will be pre-masked.

Once you are happy with your art layout you can print it at 100% onto either a 8x10 or 8.5x11 sheet.  

It is important to ensure you print at 100% so the image size stays correct.

I printed all of mine on an Epson Ecotank using Epson premium photo paper.  I have not tested this on other paper.

!!!Please note - I am not responcible for missprints or any costs incured from missprints!!!

There are some cutting guide points on the template as well.

Using scissors or a knife cut the top and bottom lines on the marked points.  There is an extra strip at the top to ensure you do not get any white paper showing through.  

!!!Please note - I am not responcible for injury that results from improper use of a knife or scissors.  If you are unable to use a knife or scissors ask someone who is more comfortable for help!!!

If you have a black or red sharpie you can color the thickness of the paper so that it does not show the white of the photo paper once installed.

Using scissors or a knife cut the left and right edges, there will no longer be marking points (as you just cut them off) but you want to go about 1mm into the color on both sides.  

!!!Please note - I am not responcible for injury that results from improper use of a knife or scissors.  If you are unable to use a knife or scissors ask someone who is more comfortable for help!!!

You can test fit this and see if any adjustments are needed.
