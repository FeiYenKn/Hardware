## Summary

This is an extreamly short shaft based on the shaft used on the ones used in the Theatrhythm All-Star Carnival arcade cabinet.  

It is recommended to have this done in Aluminum and have it both bead blasted and anodized.  I have not tested other materials or finishes.


## How to order one

All of the boards so far have been ordered though JLCPCB.  Due to minimum order numbers you would need to get at least five of these basic breakout boards.  Here are the steps to make your first order and the options I chose along the way.

1 - Go to JLCPCB.com<br/>

2 - Click on `Order Now`<br/>

3 - Click on `3D Printing/CNC`<br/>

4 - Click on `CNC Machining`<br/>

5 - Click on `Upload 3D models` and choose the file named `THEATRYTHM_JLF_SHAFT.step` from the `Hardware files` folder<br/>

6 - Choose the following options for the board:<br/>
- Material = Aluminum<br/>
- Type of Aluminum = Aluminum 6061<br/>
- Surface Finish = Yes -> Bead blasting + Anodizing -> Natural -> Matte<br/>
- Tightest Tolerance = ISO 2768 medium<br/>
- Smallest Roughness = Ra3.2<br/>
- Threads = Yes<br/>

A new box will pop up and ask you to upload a PDF, DWG, DXF, JPG or PNG.  Upload the `THEATRYTHM_JLF_SHAFT_DRAWING.pdf` file from the `Hardware files` folder<br/>

- Sub-assembly = No<br/>
- Product Desc = Choose what you think fits best.<br/>

On the right hand side you will see a `Build time` selection.  It should default to `Standard`.  You can save a few bucks by moving that to `Economic`.<br/>

If all looks well here you can check off `I agree to JLCCNC's terms of use` and then click on the `Submit Order` button.

You will be taken to the shipping and shipping method page.  This will change based on where you are located.
