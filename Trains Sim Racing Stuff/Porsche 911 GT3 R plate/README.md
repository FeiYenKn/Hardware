## Summary

This is a simple GT3 R logo print for attaching to your aluminum extrusion racing rig.  This will fit on 4040/4080 etc.

You will need 2x M8 countersunk bolts and 2x M8 aluminum profile nuts to hold this on.  

Other sizes can be made, please see the included STEP file for any modifications you want to make.  


## Printing tips

Print with 4x walls to ensure solid sides.

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.
