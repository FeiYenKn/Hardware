## Summary:

The Open Stick Astro (OSASTRO) is a new entry in the growing OS case linup.  

The OSASTRO is an open source stick designed as a tribute to the Virtua Stick High Grade and newer Astro Mini stick.

It features 6 face buttons and 4 aux buttons.

The small button holes are 24.05mm.

The aux button holes are also 24.05mm.

This model was designed around a normal Sanwa JLF and the newer OSBMX v2 buttons.

## Printing and Construction:

This project is now complete and I have printed and checked the final version of each file.  If there are improvements made and those files will be posted when I make them.

Please note that I am not taking on requests for other layouts at this time.  The STLs and STEP files have been posted so you can be easily edited in TinkerCAD or Fusion360 (or the program of your choice).

This case was printed on a Bambu Labs X1C and P1S printer with the following changes to settings:
- 0.20mm layer height
- 4 outer walls
- Hex infill
- 15% infill

Please note that a brim is recommended when printing the main case and it has been added into the included .3MF file.

Based on my prints the entire case takes around 510 grams of filament so you should be able to easily get a case out of a single 1kg roll.  

This case was printed using Bambu Labs matte PLA filament, I have not tested it with other filaments.

Each piece should be placed flat down on the print bed to ensure maximum strength except the main frame which should be printed vertically. 

The following hardware is needed to assemble the case:
- 4x M4 35mm brass standoffs
- 12x M4 14mm countersunk hex bolts
- 4x M4 flange nuts
- 2x M3 24mm countersunk hex bolts
- 2x M3 flange nuts

Assembly:
- The 35mm brass standoffs will go into the four holes in the side panels
- The top plate and main frame will bolt into one side of the side panels 
- The bottom plate will bolt into the other side of the side panels
