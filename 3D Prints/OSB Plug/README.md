## Summary

The OSB Plug is a simple screw in plug for 30mm and 24mm button holes. 

---

## How to print the OSBMX v2:

A .3MF file is included which can be loaded into most slicers with a set of my recommended settings.  

To make each plug you will need:
1 x OSB Plug body<br/>
1 x OSB Plug nut<br/>

These parts should both be printed upside down.  

There are no supports needed for this print.  

It is recommended to print at the lowest print layer height your printer can do.  

I have extensivly printed and tested these on my BambuLabs X1C and P1S using both a 0.4mm and 0.2mm nozzle on normal and matte PLA.  

The recommended print setting are to do 4-6 wall loops and then enough top and bottom laters to have solid infill.  

You may need to adjust to achieve a good print on your own printer.
